# Learning: the acquisition of skills

   Task: T :
   Performance : P
   Experience : E

# Challenges:
-----------------

    -Data quality
    -Time consuming
    -Model will be overfitting or underfitting
    -Dimention reduction / Curse of dimensionality
    -difficity in deployment

    Algorithms: 
        -many basic effective and efficient algorithms are available
    Data:
        -Large amount of data is available in on-line form.
    Computing:
        -Large amount of computational resources available.

# ML Prerequisit for modelling:
------------------------------
    -Computer science
    -Applied Maths
    -Statistics
    -Probability

# Programming language:
------------------------
  -Python
  -R

# Framework and Libraries:
-------------------------
  Web development:
  -(server side) Dajango, Flask, Cherrypy
  -GUI: tkinter

# Lib:
------
  -Numpy = scipy (scientific python) + matplotlib
  -Pandas = dataset (series, dataframe)
  -Matplotlib = graph plotting (scatter plot, ggplot, histogram..)
  --------------
  -Tensorflow
  -keras


# Machine Learning: 
-----------------
  -It is a concept which allows the machine to learn from examples 
  and experiences, and that too without being explicitly programmed.

# Types of learning:

# Supervised:
-----------------
  -Labelled
  -guidance will be provided
  -explicitly learning model
  -predicts the future outcomes
  -train the algorithm on a labelled dataset 
  and then we will set it to prediction
  -Input/ Output
  -classification, prediction
  -Real life eg.

# Unsupervised:
------------------------
  -Not labelled
  -No guidance (self learning)
  -identify the pattens, trends.
  -can not predict 
  -train an algorithms to find patterns
  (similarities/ abnormalities)
  -Input
  -Cluster,anomaly detection
  -Real life eg.
